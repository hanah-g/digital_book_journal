# digital_book_journal

This is my website I created with HTML. 

My biggest hobby is reading, but because I read a book or two a week, I have a hard time keeping track of what books I've read, 
and how much I liked the book. This problem was exacerbated upon going to college, and having some books with me in Missouri
and some at home in California. My solution was to find an easy way to collect my reviews of the books I've read. I was never able to stick
to any of the existing websites, such as goodreads, just because I wanted something faster and simpler for everyday use.

While I am happy with how much I've learned just from building a website from scratch, I do 
want to take this project further. 

My next steps are to enable the creation of accounts to save these tables so users can return to them for future use, and I want to make sure
I include enough security measures to protect the website (for example, from SQL injection attacks).

Thank you for checking out my code! :)
